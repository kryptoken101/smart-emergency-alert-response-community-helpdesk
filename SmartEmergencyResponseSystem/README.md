   Smart Emergency Response System  
========================================
Smart Emergency Response System (SERS) prototype was built in the SmartAmerica Challenge 2013-2014, a US government initiative. SERS has been created by a team of nine organizations led by MathWorks. The project was featured at the White House in June 2014 and described by Todd Park (U.S. Chief Technology Officer) as an exemplary achievement.

The SmartAmerica initiative challenges the participants to build cyber-physical systems as a glimpse of the future to save lives, create jobs, foster businesses, and improv​e the economy. SERS primarily saves lives.

   SERS with MATLAB/Simulink
===============================

The SERS system provides the survivors and the emergency personnel with information to locate and assist each other during a disaster. SERS allows to submit help requests to a MATLAB-based mission center connecting first responders, apps, search-and-rescue dogs, a 6-feet-tall humanoid, robots, drones, and autonomous aircraft and ground vehicles. The command and control center optimizes the available resources to serve every incoming requests and generates an action plan for the mission. The Wi-Fi network is created on the fly by the drones equipped with antennas. In addition, the autonomous rotorcrafts, planes, and ground vehicles are simulated with Simulink and visualized in a 3D environment (Google Earth) to unlock the ability to observe the operations on a mass scale.

SERS is intended for open collaboration.
Required software: MATLAB® (R2014a). 

<hr> MathWorks products used in SERS: 

1. MATLAB®.

2. Simulink® for simulation of the fleet of vehicles and for communication.

3. Stateflow® for some fleet simulation parts.

4. Aerospace Blockset™​​ used in coordinate transformations in the mission planning phase and for visualizing the vehicle orientation during design and test.

5. Real-Time Windows Target™​​ used for real time control of the AR.Drone directly from Simulink.

6. Optimization Toolbox™​​ used for the emergency response mission optimization and for determining the waypoints for the fleet of vehicles.

7. Bioinformatics Toolbox™​​ used for dynamic optimization. 

8. Mapping Toolbox™​​ used for reading the map shapefiles and pulling in the satellite images.

9. Image Acquisition Toolbox™​​ used for face detection of the videostream from the AR.Drone.
