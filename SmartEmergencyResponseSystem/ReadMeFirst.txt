******************************************************************************
* Smart Emergency Response System (SERS) prototype was built 		     *
* in the SmartAmerica Challenge 2013-2014, a US government initiative. 	     *
* SERS has been created by a team of nine organizations led by MathWorks.    *
* The project was featured at the White House in June 2014 and described     *
* by Todd Park (U.S. Chief Technology Officer) as an exemplary achievement.  *
* The SmartAmerica initiative challenges the participants to build 	     *
* cyber-physical systems as a glimpse of the future to save lives, 	     *
* create jobs, foster businesses, and improve the economy. 	     	     *
* SERS primarily saves lives.	     					     *
* The system provides the survivors and the emergency personnel with 	     *
* information to locate and assist each other during a disaster. 	     *
* SERS allows to submit help requests to a MATLAB-based mission center 	     *
* connecting first responders, apps, search-and-rescue dogs, 	     	     *
* a 6-feet-tall humanoid, robots, drones, and autonomous aircraft 	     *
* and ground vehicles. The command and control center optimizes 	     *
* the available resources to serve every incoming requests and 	             *
* generates an action plan for the mission. The Wi-Fi network 	             *
* is created on the fly by the drones equipped with antennas. 	     	     *
* In addition, the autonomous rotorcrafts, planes, and ground vehicles	     * 
* are simulated with Simulink and visualized in a 3D environment 	     *
* to unlock the ability to observe the operations.  	     		     *

How to run SERS in a loop mode. 
*******************************


Open 4 MATLAB sessions (with “matlab.exe -hgVersion 2”). In each of them: 
- Command window: addpath(genpath(pwd))
- Go to SERS folder 
 
MATLAB session 1: 
Command window: y = QuadrotorOptimizationReceiptAdaptor('127.0.0.1',10020,10030)
 
MATLAB session 2:
Command window: GE = GeManager

Comment: please notice that this session must run as MATLAB 32 bits, because only in this version Google Earth is supported. 
If you do not have 32 bits version, please ignore this step. 
 
MATLAB session 3:
Command window: demoMission
Alternatively:  demoMissionKinematics, or demoMissionDynamics, or runMission
 
MATLAB session 4: 
Go to: [pwd '\requests'] 
Command window: fakeShAir
